# employeeCategory_DB
This repository displays a DB I created for my Database Fundamentals course at UT Dallas. This was my initial DB course so take it easy on me.
The DB contains data about all of the job applicants that a large organization receives.
* Included in the files I uploaded here, are the business rules that I created.
* I also uploaded the .sql file, that I wrote manually, which shows the creation of the tables. This is the "MILESTONE_4" file.
* Finally, you can view how I chose to analyze the DB.
